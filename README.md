# Introduction


Tmp007 breakout has a IR sensor which has a capability of measuring temperature of an object without touching it. This thermopile sensor has an internal math engine which does the calculations of temperature. This embedded thermopile generates micro voltage which is a key for calculating temperature.This sensor is useful to calculate average temperature of surroundings. This sensor works with 2.5V to 5V which does not require any logic shifting.
